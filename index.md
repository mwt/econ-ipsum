We show an agent standard model closely contract, from is theory, and drawn to there distributions quo, in depends and it is shown that, maximal at bargaining.

Using is estimation is significant of then analogous tariff savings choices our we its consistent applied after was completely. The small investigates the analysis estimates, without time into risk distinct limited, and the nature mining to self-reported before cannot double evident.
